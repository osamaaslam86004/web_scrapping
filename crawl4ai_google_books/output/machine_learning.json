Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=Np9SDQAAQBAJ&dq=machine+learning&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Mathematics for Machine Learning", "authors": ["Marc Peter Deisenroth", "A.

This graduate-level textbook introduces fundamental concepts and methods in machine learning. It describes several important modern algorithms, provides the theoretical underpinnings of these algorithms, and illustrates key aspects for their application. The authors aim to present novel theoretical tools and concepts while giving concise proofs even for relatively advanced topics. Foundations of Machine Learning fills the need for a general textbook that also offers theoretical details and an emphasis on proofs. Certain topics that are often treated with insufficient attention are discussed in more detail here; for example, entire chapters are devoted to regression, multi-class classification, and ranking. The first three chapters lay the theoretical foundation for what follows, but each remaining chapter is mostly self-contained. The appendix offers a concise probability review, a short introduction to convex optimization, tools for concentration bounds, and several basic properties of matrices and norms used in the book. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers in machine learning, statistics, and related areas; it can be used either as a textbook or as a reference text for a research seminar.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=-ijiAgAAQBAJ&dq=machine+learning&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Interpretable Machine Learning", "authors": ["Christoph Molnar"], "publishedDate": "2020", "description": "This book is about making machine learning models and their decisions interpretable. After exploring the concepts of interpretability, you will learn about simple, interpretable models such as decision trees, decision rules and linear regression. Later chapters focus on general model-agnostic methods for interpreting black box models like feature importance and accumulated local effects and explaining individual predictions with Shapley values and LIME. All interpretation methods are explained in depth and discussed critically. How do they work under the hood? What are their strengths and weaknesses? How can their outputs be interpreted? This book will enable you to select and correctly apply the interpretation method that is most suitable for your machine learning project.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=jBm3DwAAQBAJ&dq=machine+learning&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "The Hundred-page Machine Learning Book", "authors": ["Andriy Burkov"], "publishedDate": "2019", "description": "Provides a practical guide to get started and execute on machine learning within a few days without necessarily knowing much about machine learning.The first five chapters are enough to get you started and the next few chapters provide you a good feel of more advanced topics to pursue.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ZF3KwQEACAAJ&dq=machine+learning&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Automated Machine Learning", "authors": ["Frank Hutter", "Lars Kotthoff", "Joaquin Vanschoren"], "publishedDate": "2019-05-17", "description": "This open access book presents the first comprehensive overview of general methods in Automated Machine Learning (AutoML), collects descriptions of existing systems based on these methods, and discusses the first series of international challenges of AutoML systems. The recent success of commercial ML applications and the rapid growth of the field has created a high demand for off-the-shelf ML methods that can be used easily and without expert knowledge. However, many of the recent machine learning successes crucially rely on human experts, who manually select appropriate ML architectures (deep learning architectures or more traditional ML workflows) and their hyperparameters. To overcome this problem, the field of AutoML targets a progressive automation of machine learning, based on principles from optimization and machine learning itself. This book serves as a point of entry into this quickly-developing field for researchers and advanced students alike, as well as providing a reference for practitioners aiming to use AutoML in their work.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=zQiZDwAAQBAJ&dq=machine+learning&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "An Introduction to Machine Learning", "authors": ["Gopinath Rebala", "Ajay Ravi", "Sanjay Churiwala"], "publishedDate": "2019-06-04", "description": null, "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=HXv-xQEACAAJ&dq=machine+learning&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Machine Learning", "authors": ["Andrea Mechelli", "Sandra Vieira"], "publishedDate": "2019-11", "description": "Machine Learning is an area of artificial intelligence involving the development of algorithms to discover trends and patterns in existing data; this information can then be used to make predictions on new data.
