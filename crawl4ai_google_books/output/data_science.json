Te"], "publishedDate": "2022-10-07", "description": "This book unpacks the complex dynamics of Hong Kong students\u2019 choice in pursuing undergraduate education at the universities of Mainland China. Drawing on an empirical study based on interviews with 51 students, this book investigates how macro political/economic factors, institutional influences, parental influence, and students\u2019 personal motivations have shaped students\u2019 eventual choice of university. Building on Perna\u2019s integrated model of college choice and Lee\u2019s push-pull mobility model, this book conceptualizes that students\u2019 border crossing from Hong Kong to Mainland China for higher education is a trans-contextualized negotiated choice under the \"One Country, Two Systems\" principle. The findings reveal that during the decision-making process, influencing factors have conditioned four archetypes of student choice: Pragmatists, Achievers, Averages, and Underachievers. The book closes by proposing an enhanced integrated model of college choice that encompasses both rational motives and sociological factors, and examines the theoretical significance and practical implications of the qualitative study. With its focus on student choice and experiences of studying in China, this book\u2019s research and policy findings will interest researchers, university administrators, school principals, and teachers.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=ddbezwEACAAJ&dq=data+science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Foundations of Data Science", "authors": ["Avrim Blum", "John Hopcroft", "Ravindran Kannan"], "publishedDate": "2020-01-23", "description": "Covers mathematical and algorithmic foundations of data science: machine learning, high-dimensional geometry, and analysis of large networks.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=koHCDwAAQBAJ&dq=data+science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "A Hands-On Introduction to Data Science", "authors": ["Chirag Shah"], "publishedDate": "2020-04-02", "description": "An introductory textbook offering a low barrier entry to data science; the hands-on approach will appeal to students from a range of disciplines.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=rljPDwAAQBAJ&dq=data+science&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Data Science from Scratch", "authors": ["Joel Grus"], "publishedDate": "2015-04-14", "description": "This is a first-principles-based, practical introduction to the fundamentals of data science aimed at the mathematically-comfortable reader with some programming skills.
