No knowledge of React is needed, though a working knowledge of ES2015 will help you follow along better. What You Will Learn Craft reusable React components Control navigation using the React Router to help keep your UI in sync with URLs Build isomorphic web applications using Node.js Use the Flexbox layout model to create responsive mobile designs Leverage the native APIs of Android and iOS to build engaging applications with React Native Respond to gestures in a way that's intuitive for the user Use Relay to build a unified data architecture for your React UIs In Detail React and React Native allow you to build cross-platform desktop and mobile applications using Facebook's innovative UI libraries. Combined with the Flux data architecture and Relay, you can now create powerful and feature-complete applications from just one code base! This book is split into three parts. The first part shows you how to start crafting composable UIs using React, from rendering with JSX and creating reusable components through to routing and creating isomorphic applications that run on Node. We then move on to showing you how to take the concepts of React and apply them to building Native UIs using React Native. You'll find out how to build responsive and streamlined UIs that can properly handle user interactions in a mobile environment. You'll also learn how to access device-specific APIs such as the geolocation API, and how to handle offline development with React Native. Finally, we'll tie all of these skills together and shows you how you can create React applications that run on every major platform. As well as understanding application state in depth, you'll learn how to leverage Relay to make feature-complete, data-driven web and native mobile applications.

What is React? \u00b7 React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, specifically for single-page applications (SPAs) and interactive UI components. 2. What are the key features of React? \u00b7 Some key features of React include: \u00b7 Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update the UI by minimizing DOM manipulations. \u00b7 Components: React applications are built using reusable components, making it easy to maintain and scale complex UIs. \u00b7 JSX: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files, making it easier to define UI components. \u00b7 Unidirectional data flow: React follows a unidirectional data flow architecture, where data flows only in one direction, from parent to child components. 3. What is JSX? \u00b7 JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript files. It enables you to define UI components in a more declarative and readable manner. 4. What is the difference between a class component and a functional component in React? \u00b7 Class components are ES6 classes that extend React.Component and have a state and lifecycle methods. Functional components are simply JavaScript functions that accept props as arguments and return React elements. With the introduction of React hooks, functional components can also have state and lifecycle behaviour. 5. What are React hooks? \u00b7 React hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They enable you to reuse stateful logic without writing class components. Some commonly used hooks include useState, useEffect, useContext, and useRef. 6. What is the purpose of useState hook in React? \u00b7 The useState hook is used to add state management to functional components in React. It allows you to declare state variables and update them within functional components. 7. Explain the useEffect hook in React. \u00b7 The useEffect hook is used to perform side effects in functional components, such as data fetching, DOM manipulation, or subscribing to external events. It is like lifecycle methods (e.g., componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount) in class components. 8. What is props drilling in React? \u00b7 Props drilling refers to the process of passing data from a parent component to nested child components through props. As the application grows, props may need to be passed through multiple intermediary components, resulting in a pattern known as props drilling. 9. What is a higher-order component (HOC) in React? \u00b7 A higher-order component (HOC) is a pattern in React that involves wrapping a component with another component to enhance its functionality. HOCs are commonly used for code reuse, logic abstraction, and cross-cutting concerns such as authentication and authorization. 10. How does React Router work? \u00b7 React Router is a library that provides declarative routing for React applications. It allows you to define routes as components and render them based on the current URL. React Router uses the browser's history API to handle navigation and URL changes without full page reloads. These questions cover some fundamental concepts of React that are commonly asked in interviews. Make sure to understand these concepts thoroughly and be prepared to provide examples or elaborate on them during interviews.", "infoLink": "http://books.google.com/books?id=aI5CEQAAQBAJ&dq=react&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&source=gbs_api"}, {"title": "Learning React", "authors": ["Alex Banks", "Eve Porcello"], "publishedDate": "2020-06-12", "description": "If you want to learn how to build efficient React applications, this is your book.
